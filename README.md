# Alpha Clicker 1.4

Welcome to Alpha Clicker 1.4! This update brings a host of exciting new features and improvements designed to enhance your user experience. Below is a detailed overview of the new features included in this release.

**Reminder** This is not the original program, it is created as an update based on user feedback on https://github.com/robiot/AlphaClicker

## New Features

### 1. New Theme System
The theme system has been completely revamped. The new dynamic theme manager now allows for easy integration of user-created themes, along with four stock themes: Light, Dark, Nature, and Undecided.

- **Adding Custom Themes:** To add your own themes, simply place them in the `User Themes` folder within the application directory. Creating themes is straightforward: duplicate the `BaseThemeTemplate.xaml` file and open it with a text editor to customize.

**Theme Files** are easy to both create and understand. Everything that needs to be done is change the HEX colors. Be mindful of not deleting other stuff since it will break.

### 2. Mouse Click Holding Option
You can now select "Hold Mouse Click" from the dropdown menu of click types.

### 3. Revamped Settings System
The settings menu has been significantly improved. The new system allows you to save all settings, so you wonâ€™t need to reconfigure them each time. Additionally, themes and "Top Most" settings now save independently of the "Save All Settings" function.

### 4. Process Selecting
A new feature in the settings menu, "Process Selecting," allows you to enable clicking only within a specific application. This means you can toggle clicking on, minimize the application, and use your computer normally without interruption.

## Additional Changes

- **Visual Feedback:** Minimal visual changes have been made to enhance feedback on whether clicking is active.
- **Improved Keybind Selection:** The settings revamp includes an improved keybind selection for a better user experience.

## More can potentially be added before release
I have no idea what i might end up doing maybe i get bored, maybe not, the features on this list at least will be released in the coming days, just need to clean up the code a little first.

## Installation

To update to Alpha Clicker 1.4, download the latest version from the release **Not Released Yet**

This update is the result of being bored for a weekend. I do not promise to continue updating nor expect anyone to see this. It was created as a fun weekend project based on implementing user suggestions from https://github.com/robiot/AlphaClicker/issues. If there are anything else that is wanted then you can message me. My dms are always open (i think). Have a good day (or night).
